# Vuedows 3.11

Just a little fun project trying to reimplement the Windows 3.11 UI in Typescript and Vue.

Supported are the follow things:

- Window creation
- Window z ordering and activation
- Window dragging
- Window resizing (all 8 corners)
- Basic command buttons

Double clicking the desktop creates a new window (testing only).

# Development run

```
npm run serve
```

Sass needs to be started seperatly:
```
npm run sass:watch
```
